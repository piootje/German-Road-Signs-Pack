Hello everyone! Today I present my German Road signs pack (for Write Everywhere). These will offer an unique addition to German builds. 

DEPENDENCIES
To get started, you need to have Write Everywhere. It's a dependency for this mod. The Highway sign structures are also highly recommended. 

FONT
To recreate german signs to perfection, the following font is recommended: 
DIN 1451 Mittelschrift / Engschrift

MOD SETUP
1. Download the attached files and the named font (on the internet)
2. Unzip
3. Put the image folders in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\imageAtlases
If the atlases don't show up in WE try refreshing sprites.
Don't forget to setup the font.

SETUP IN-GAME
1. Place a road structure from the Highway sign structures mod.
2. Ctrl+Shift+W to open write everywhere
3. Select the structure you want to place the sign on
4. Click the ''+" icon and select place empty at root. 
5. A text will show up, so we'll have to set the content type to ''image'' in the ''content'' UI.
6. Select ''Atlas'' in the content UI and select the desired ''German Pack'' atlas. 
7. Click on image and select the desired image. WE only displays text, so you can look in the photos attached to this post to select the desired image.
8. Some of the images will spawn in very small so you will have to adjust the size (Base height). You might have to adjust the position aswell.
9. *(Optional) *Signs dont have a backside so they will mirror themselves on the backside. To stop this add a white texture (as child from sign) and adjust it's size and slightly move it to the back. You can change it's color aswell.

PLACING TEXT
Make sure the font is setup correctly. 
1. When you have your sign, add a text as child from the sign.
2. Change font, size and position.

It might seem as a lot but it's really not that hard. Making a sign takes very short time once you know what you're doing. Have fun with the pack everyone!
